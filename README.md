Hi! This is my personal portfolio created with sveltekit. Feel free to look at my code or even use it if you like it so. I plan to add to this site as I gain experience and make more projects and also to create a subdomain with fun things like small web games and apps.

## Early Mockups
These are some early mockups, made in affinity designer, of the current site rendition I thought would be interesting to share.![Early mockup of home page with sidebar navigation](https://i.imgur.com/r0OZVoC.png)

## Even Earlier Idea

Before the current rendition of the site I imagined and worked in a version of the portofolio with a discord like look but couldnt find a way to make it work as a portfolio. Hopefully I get to do something with it but for now its a WIP. It's [here.](https://github.com/TophC7/toph)
